## 👾 About Me

I'm a CS student diving deep into **graphics programming** and **technical art**. My goal is to build solid tools that help artists bring their ideas to life. If it involves **low-level graphics, game development, or research**, I'm interested.

When I'm not coding, I'm either:
- Exploring computer graphics 🖼️
- Reading computer science literature 📚 (currently into Donald Knuth's *The Art of Computer Programming*)
- Growing **Carolina Reapers** and other spicy plants 🌶️
- Experimenting with different game engines 🎮

- **Languages:** C, Python, C#, JavaScript
- **Editor:** Neovim (Kickstart.nvim)
- **Other:** Git, Linux
